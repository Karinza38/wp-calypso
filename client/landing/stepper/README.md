# Stepper Signup and Onboarding Framework

The stepper framework is a new framework for quickly spinning up sign-up flows. This is a non-linear solution that doesn't sacrifice agility âœ¨.

## Non-linearity

It has been tricky for us to create flows with input-driven steps configuration. Stepper makes it easy by using `useStepNavigation`. This hook has access to the state of the flow so it makes navigation decisions based on it at every stage of the flow.

### Example flow

```ts
import type { StepPath } from './internals/steps-repository';
import type { Flow } from './internals/types';

export const exampleFlow: Flow = {
	initialize() {
		return [ STEPS.DOMAINS, STEPS.DESIGN ];
	},
	useStepNavigation( currentStep, navigate ) {
		const goBack = () => {
			if ( currentStep === 'domain' ) {
				navigate( 'design' );
			} else {
				navigate( 'domain' );
			}
		};
		const goNext = goBack;
		return { goNext, goBack };
	},
};
```

## The API

To create a flow, you only have to implement `initialize` and `useStepNavigation`. `initialize` can do any checks you need and it should finally return an array of step objects, `useStepNavigation` is the engine where you make navigation decisions. This hook returns an object of type [`NavigationControls`](./declarative-flow/internals/types.ts):

There is also an optional `useSideEffect` hook. You can implement this hook to run any side-effects to the flow. You can prefetch information, send track events when something changes, etc...

There is a required `isSignupFlow` flag that _MUST be `true` for signup flows_ (generally where a new site may be created), and should be `false` for other flows. The `isSignupFlow` flag controls whether we'll trigger a `calypso_signup_start` Tracks event when the flow starts. For signup flows, you can also supply additional event props to the `calypso_signup_start` event by implementing the optional `useTracksEventProps()` hook on the flow.

```tsx
/**
 * This is the return type of useStepNavigation hook
 */
export type NavigationControls = {
	/**
	 * Submits the answers provided in the flow
	 */
	submit?: ( providedDependencies?: ProvidedDependencies, ...params: string[] ) => void;
};
```

Since this is a hook, it can access any state from any store, so you can make dynamic navigation decisions based on the state. [Here](./declarative-flow/site-setup-flow.ts) is a developed example of this hook.

```ts
import type { Flow } from './internals/types';

export const exampleFlow: Flow = {
	initialize() {
		return [
			STEPS.DOMAINS,
			STEPS.PLANS,
		];
	},
	useStepNavigation( currentStep, navigate ) {
		return { goNext, goBack };
	},
};
```

## Reusability

Stepper aims to create a big `steps-repository` that contains the steps and allows them to be recycled and reused. Every step you create is inherently reusable by any future flow. Because steps are like components, they're not parts of the flows, flows just happen to use them.

This creates a couple of restrictions.

To maintain the reusability and simplicity of this framework it is important that flow-specific styling changes be made to a `flow` stylesheet or in `global.scss`. Each step should have the basic styling necessary to operate on its own just like a package.

And each step should only get flow-level state from a store (not props).

## Renaming Steps

There may be a time when a step needs to be renamed. In order to preserve Tracks data and funnels, we recommend adding a new entry to `getStepOldSlug` in the `FlowRenderer` component. This ensures that tracks events will fire with both the new step slug and the old step slug.

## State management

Steps shouldn't have any props other than the `navigation` prop which contains the return value of `useStepNavigation`. This object (`navigation`) allows the step to `submit` when done or to move to other steps or to `goNext`, `goBack`, etc..

The rationale behind this is the following:

1. **Small API**: when steps have such small API surface area, they can be reused easily.
2. **Centralized state**: the `useStepNavigation` hook makes decisions based on the entire flow's state, so the state has to be centralized, i.e: lives entirely in the `onboard` store (or any store inside `packages/data-stores`).

All the state should be either in the onboarding store or the internal state of the step. This creates a flat data tree that is exactly one level deep and allows steps to be easily created and re-used.

It takes five minutes to add a new field to the `onboard` store. Such as [`intent`](../../../packages/data-stores/src/onboard/reducer.ts) or [`storeType`](../../../packages/data-stores/src/onboard/reducer.ts).

## Preferring packages

When creating new code, it's highly-encouraged to put it into packages, whether existing like `onboarding` or new packages that you create. This allows us to create flows in the future that live in wp-admin or wherever.
